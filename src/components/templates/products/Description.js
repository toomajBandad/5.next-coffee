        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
        has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, <span className="font-semibold">consectetur</span>, from a
        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of{" "}
        <em>“de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum”</em> (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
        by Cicero, written in 45 BC.

        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
        randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
        going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
        necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using <code>'Content here, content here'</code>,
        making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
        and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text.
